# Facial Expression Recognition And Face Detection

GOAL_

The goal of facial expression recognition and face detection is to develop computer algorithms that can identify and analyze facial features in images or videos. Facial expression recognition aims to identify the emotions or moods being conveyed by an individual's facial expressions, while face detection is focused on identifying and localizing faces within an image or video.

PROCESS_

To develop a facial expression recognition or face detection system, various computer vision techniques can be used and Technology like keras, Image Processing Libraries-OpenCV are used

DETAILS OF FEATURES_

Important features of facial expression recognition and face detection systems include their accuracy, speed, and ability to work with a variety of image and video formats. Additionally, these systems may need to be able to work with different lighting conditions, facial poses, and facial expressions to provide reliable results, These systems may find applications in fields such as human-computer interaction, security, and healthcare.
